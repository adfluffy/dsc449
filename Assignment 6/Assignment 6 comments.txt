# Part 1

# After running the modelCompare function on the three RGB regressions it becomes
# apparent that the third model format (X1~X2) has the strongest relationship.
# This is based on the .3 regression format having the highest r value, adjusted
# r squared, and independent variable t-score across all colors. However, since
# we are more interested in determining the strength of a model that can match a
# known RGB value to the RGB values determined by a sensor, this relationship is
# not incredibly useful. Instead, we will perform the modelCompare operation again
# but this time only on regression models 1 and 2. This should tell us whether the
# X1 or X2 method of sensor arrangement is better equipped to perceive the RGB values
# of the paint we are studying. 

# In the new data frame (rgb.summary.1.2) we can see now that regression test 2
# (X~X2) provides the more compelling model. Regression model 3 (X1~X2) measured
# the ability to determine a sensor reading (X1) from another sensor reading (X2).
# This can be useful in determining if the sensor is operating reliably, but if we
# are instead interested in a regression model that allows us to determine a paint
# color from a sensor reading then regression model 2 provides use with that. The
# adjusted r squared values for model 2 are:
#    (Adjusted R Squared)
#    red   -> 0.8769735
#    green -> 0.9343078
#    blue  -> 0.8273811
# These adjusted r squared values indicate that test 2 is a strong predictor of
# the true color of paint presented to the sensor. Additionally, the model 2 r
# squared values (below) similarly show that the model is a good fit for the 
# data that we provided:
#    (R Squared)
#    red   -> 0.8808181
#    green -> 0.9363607
#    blue  -> 0.8327755
# (This summary information is all available within the rgb.summary.1.2 data frame)
# All this data implies that black hose washer providing light shielding to the 
# sensor improves its ability to detect colors accurately.


# Finally, after running the modelComapre function on the color_calb associated
# models we can determine that regression model 2 (X~X.LED.on.) performs better
# than model 1 (X~X.[Color]). The adjusted r squared values for the colors tested
# are:
#    (Adjusted R Squared)
#    red   -> 0.8496817
#    green -> 0.9223584
#    blue  -> 0.8044472
# This adjusted r squared values imply that the models are able to predict the actual
# paint color relatively well, and when combined with their r squared values (below)
# we can see that the model is the more robust option.
#    (R Squared)
#    red   -> 0.8533480
#    green -> 0.9242521
#    blue  -> 0.8092168
# (Summary information provided above is all availible in the calb.summary data frame)
# Since we are trying to determine the best set up method for the light sensor on
# the arduino board, the regression models created here imply that the white light
# LED is better for allowing the sensor to determine the paint color presented
# to it.

# Part 2

# Based on the results of the dominance analysis performed on the bc.data data frame
# the most influencital factors on malignancy are:
# 1) Bare Nuclei            (0.144)    
# 2) Cell Shape Uniformity  (0.130)
# 3) Cell Size Uniformity   (0.125)
# 4) Clump Thickness        (0.111)
# 5) Bland Chromatin        (0.105)
# 6) Marginal Adhesion      (0.077)
# 7) Normal Nucleoli        (0.076)
# 8) Single Epithelial Cell (0.073)
# 9) Mitoses                (0.034)
# Additionally, parsing the information in the bm.complete, bm.conditional, and
# bm.general matrices will give information on the dominance of factors in the 
# model (1 means dominant, 0 means submissive,0.5 means not determinable). Alternatively,
# the dom.factors vector is a list of factors and their dominance status over other
# factors in the model. Either review method will yield the user more information
# regarding factor dominance in the model.
